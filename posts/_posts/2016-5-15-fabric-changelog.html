  <h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
  <img src="/article_assets/1.6.2.png" style="margin-bottom:20px">

  <p>With 1.6.2 we introduce some new customization options for controls and user interaction. It is now possible to customize the keys used for control interaction.<br />Before those where the predefined keys:</p>
<pre>
Alt Key: Switching from normal transform to centered transform during scaling objects.
Shift Key: on br,bl,tr,lt was switching from proportional to free resize, on mt, ml, mr, bw was switching between resize and skew.
</pre>
<p>As of 1.6.2 is possible to use those configuration option to define which keys are used:</p>
<pre>
* values: altKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey, 
fabric.Object.uniScaleKey: key used to switch between proportional and not proportional scaling
fabric.Object.altActionKey: key used to switch between different action on same corner (skew/scale)
fabric.Object.centeredKey: key used to switch on/off the centered transform
</pre>
<p><code>hoverCursor</code> now appears also on non selectable objects but <code>moveCursor</code> does not appear if the object can't be moved. In addition <code>moveCursor</code> is now customizable with the property <code>moveCursor</code>.
<br/>The biggest change is the possibility of cusomizing the look of controls. Both border and controls can be filled and stroked and can also have a dash-array instead of a continue line. Corners can be both square or round.<br />To control those feature you can use those new properties:
<pre>
borderDashArray: Dash stroke of borders
cornerDashArray: Dash stroke of corners
cornerStrokeColor: If corners are filled, this property controls the color of the stroke
cornerStyle: standrd 'rect' or 'circle'
selectionBackgroundColor: add an opaque or transparent layer to the selected object.
</pre>
</p>

<p>Small bugfixes includes: Itext firing <code>object:modified</code> on text change, possibility to restore custom canvas properties other than objects during canvas loadFromJSON, some SVG color output fix and some dataURL improvements.<br />This is the raw changelog:</p>
